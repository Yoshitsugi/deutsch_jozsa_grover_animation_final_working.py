# Quantum Algorithm Simulation: Deutsch-Jozsa & Grover Search  
*A Python-based simulation of quantum state evolution using QuTiP and Matplotlib*

> This project demonstrates how two foundational quantum algorithms â€” the **Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm** and **Grover's search algorithm** â€” can be simulated using Python. The implementation includes:
> - A **virtual shuffled table** to simulate unstructured data  
> - **Bloch sphere animations** to visualize quantum state evolution  
> - **Probability bar charts** showing measurement probabilities at each step  
> - **Code generation of key frames** for academic use
